An error occurred while the connection was being established. A network problem occurred. For help solving the problem, see Remote Desktop in Help and Support.&quot;,
            `4` = &quot;Extended Reason: The remote session ended because the total login time limit was reached. This limit is set by the server administrator or by network policies.&quot;,
            `5` = &quot;Extended Reason: Your Remote Desktop Services session has ended. Another user connected to the remote computer, so your connection was lost. Try connecting again, or contact your network administrator or technical support  group.&quot;,
